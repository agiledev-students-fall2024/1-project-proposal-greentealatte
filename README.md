# Project Proposal

# NYC Soho Shopping Route Generator

## What and Why?
We want building a New York Soho Shopping Route Generator that curates custom shopping routes based on user selection of fashion trends (Athflow, Balletcore, Y2K, etc) or store categories (fashion, accessories, cosmetics, luxury, etc). The system solves the problem of overwhelm and inefficiency while navigating through scattered & spread out shopping district like Soho, NYC (or potentially more shopping location globally). It is personalized, time-efficient, and can also help tourists/locals discover hidden gems or pop-up shops in real time.

## For Whom?
The software is designed for fashion-conscious shoppers, tourists, and locals who visit the shopping area. The app targets those who value efficient shopping experiences, are interested in exploring trending stores or new fashion trends. These users are typically those who:
- Visit Soho (possibly extend to LA, Beijing, Seoul) regularly or during short trips
- Prefer organized, purposeful shopping trips rather than aimlessly wandering
- Follow fashion trends/love shopping/shop a lot

## How?

### 1. User Preference Input
- **Categories**: Users can select their interest categories such as jackets, boots, shirts, etc.
- **Trend Filter**: Allows users to further refine their preferences based on style, such as Athflow, Balletcore, Y2K.
- **Price Range**: Users can set a budget to filter stores that match their spending preferences.
- **Brand Preference**: Users can choose routes that include their favorite brands or discover new ones aligned with their tastes.

### 2. Route Optimization
- **Efficient Pathfinding**: The app generates the most efficient route possible, minimizing backtracking and travel time between stores.

### 3. Interactive Map Interface
- **Map-Based Navigation**: A clear and interactive map to guide users along their shopping route.
- **Store Details**: Clickable map icons to show more information about each store, such as reviews, opening hours, and special offers.

### 4. (Optional) Dynamic Content and Real-Time Updates
- **Real-Time Store Data**: Updates on pop-up shops, sample sales, and events in Soho are provided in real-time.
- **Trending Stores**: Integration with social media and other data sources to highlight stores that are currently trending or have high traffic.

### 5. (Optional) Social Features
- **Route Sharing**: Users can share their custom routes or favorite stores with friends or on social media.
- **Community Recommendations**: Incorporate user reviews and ratings for stores and routes

## Scope
- **Core functionality**: Store data collection and route generation.
- **Advanced features**: Real-time data integration for trending stores and pop-up shops.
- **Frontend design**: User-friendly interface with interactive map and filters.

The scope of this project is appropriate for a group of 3-5 programmers within a semester. The projectâ€™s scalability allows the team to start with basic route generation and add more complex features (like real-time trends and dynamic route updates) as development progresses.
